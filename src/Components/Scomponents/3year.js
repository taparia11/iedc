          1. Smart parking is an innovative strategy that uses technology to
          reduce the effort of drivers to park their vehicles by saving their
          fuel and time.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. The Project is about to develop smart parking systems in India
          which are robust and can be built at a minimal cost.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. By using this smart parking assist we can optimize the parking
          space usage and improve the efficiency in the parking operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. This smart parking can be achieved by using the Internet of Things.
          That includes a Sensor and an app.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. Sensors tell about the Parking Area availability and the app helps
          them to book the spot, go to the spot and park the vehicle.

      <ul>
        <li>
          1.UV Clear is a novel disinfection system that helps eradicate all the
          pathogens from the dental effluent.
        </li>
        <li>
          .The dental effluent usually contains saliva, water, blood filling and
          impression materials. These substances often act as carriers of
          various pathognomic diseases such as AIDS, Hepatitis, Mucormycosis,
          Staphylococcal infections and even Covid-19.
        </li>
        <li>
          3.The UV Clear treats the effluent before it gets released into the
          sewage rapidly thereby reducing the chance of spread of these noxious
          diseases.
        </li>
        <li>
          4.The proposed project has two models of UV Clear, one for a small
          capacity which could be attached to the dental chair and the other for
          a large capacity tank containing the effluents.
        </li>
        <li>
          5.UV Clear provides a simple, efficient and unique way of annihilating
          the pathogens.
