Brace treatment is found effective in managing the curve progression and reduction of the Cobb angle. Braces apply pressure in the curvature to stop further progression and slows down the curve progression by maintaining the body in the correct posture. The patient finds the braces burdensome both emotionally and physically. Several braces resulted in complications like a pressure sore, a decrease in glomerular filtration, and muscular dystrophy.",

During the pandemic open source oxygen concentrators were developed, locally manufactured – with prices below imported products – and used, especially during a COVID-19 pandemic wave in India. An oxygen concentrator works by filtering and concentrating oxygen molecules from the ambient air to provide patients with 90% to 95% pure oxygen. An oxygen concentrator is a self-contained, electrically powered medical device designed to concentrate oxygen from ambient air. Utilizing a process known as pressure swing adsorption, an oxygen concentrator produces concentrated oxygen. Atmospheric air is drawn through a gross particle and intake filter before moving through a compressor. The pressurized air passes through a heat exchanger to reduce the temperature before entering sieve beds that contain zeolite, a mineral material that preferentially adsorbs nitrogen gas (N2) at high pressures. As each sieve bed is depressurized, N2 is released. Valves open to deliver concentrated oxygen into a reservoir where it accumulates, and from which a flowmeter can be used for measured and continuous release of oxygen to the patient at a specified flow rate.",
