The micro algae absorbs the excess CO2 and other pollutants in air, thus cleaning the air and producing O2 at the same time. We belive the perfect blend of technology and biology could together solve this deadly problem.

          <td>
            Nearly six to nine million cases are identified every year in the United States. In India, nearly five million cases are recorded every year. •This issue highly affects adolescents and mostly young females. The affected people will have a deviation of cobb angle above 10 degrees from normal. The current treatment for Scoliosis is Spinal fusion surgery and Brace treatment. Brace treatment is found effective in managing the curve progression and reduction of the Cobb angle. Braces apply pressure in the curvature to stop further progression and slows down the curve progression by maintaining the body in the correct posture. The patient finds the braces burdensome both emotionally and physically. Several braces resulted in complications like a pressure sore, a decrease in glomerular filtration, and muscular dystrophy. 
          </td>
          <td>
            Our work focuses on developing a Brace design with improved compliance, with an added advantage, and at low cost. Pressure sensor assisted brace could sense the corrective pressure application and helps in maintaining the compressive pressure to get rid of pressure sores. 
 The quality of life of patients who undergo this brace treatment is evaluated using Brace Questionnaire (BrQ). This helps in analyzing the efficiency of the developed brace in general health perception, physical functioning, emotional functioning, self-esteem and aesthetics, vitality, school activity, bodily pain and social functioning.

            Currently, if someone wants to carry out heavy computation they either need a heavy (and costly) computer or use a centralized Cloud service (Virtual Machine or ML Stack in AWS, Azure or GCP). 
People can volunteer their idle computing time to our platform and when someone else wants to perform heavy computation, the job would be divided accordingly, computed on the respectively submitted computers and sent back to the original machine.
 We feel this could eventually be made into a recurring business model where the person who wants to carry out heavy computation pays the service and the service pays the people who volunteer their computing resources.
We're planning to use C++ for handling the low-level jobs and Electron.js for the desktop application that handles the jobs. Other than that we can build a MERN stack website to host the service and signup.

Our prototype work handles the high-end security modules by developing frameworks in parallel to the IoT-based security visualization to make the system’s security an unbreakable unit. This work depicts the idea of prototyping a hardware key, termed in this paper as “AppSec Key” that handles the MFA/2FA checkpoints into a hardware level making it impossible for hackers to bypass it online using the tools.</td>
            <td>
                The visualization of IoT setup to the software security is a new revolution to the complication of mishandling data online. The project has in-depth modules in security and features inbuilt with MFA like Sequence-based Authentication that adds up an extra protection layer and User Experience.

In order to measure the light levels, we will be attaching an ambient light sensor REES 52 MAX44009 GY-49, a range sensor VL53LOX for constantly monitoring the viewing distance and a wavelength and micro spectrograph to measure spectral sensitivity and measure the light intensity which will be helpful to analyze the myopia risk factors within the broad range of visible spectrum. We will be using arduino nano 33 as the microcontroller board amd IoT to connect all sensors and to provide vibration alert and to transmit data from all sensors. The proposed device will continuously monitor the distance at which near visual activities are performed by children together with the duration of such activities. It will also track and record the ambient light levels and the spectral sensitivity to which the children are exposed to. A pre-defined threshold value will be set for the near work distance & duration and light level. </td>

In order to ensure that the remaining foods are procured or bought and delivered to these locations, the app also will operate with supported homes. By scanning waste materials, defining bio-degradable / non-biodegradable, recyclable / non-recyclable waste materials, the smart bin can be used to complete the whole waste segregation process here. Through our application framework, we facilitate the distribution in separate vehicles of these surplus foods to deserving individuals in well preserved, packed condition. The app also allows for direct interaction between registered NGOs and these gatherings and makes it possible for edible leftovers to be collected and distributed.</td>

            <td>The COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for oxygen concentrators. During the pandemic open source oxygen concentrators were developed, locally manufactured – with prices below imported products – and used, especially during a COVID-19 pandemic wave in India. An oxygen concentrator works by filtering and concentrating oxygen molecules from the ambient air to provide patients with 90% to 95% pure oxygen. An oxygen concentrator is a self-contained, electrically powered medical device designed to concentrate oxygen from ambient air. Utilizing a process known as pressure swing adsorption, an oxygen concentrator produces concentrated oxygen. Atmospheric air is drawn through a gross particle and intake filter before moving through a compressor. The pressurized air passes through a heat exchanger to reduce the temperature before entering sieve beds that contain zeolite, a mineral material that preferentially adsorbs nitrogen gas (N2) at high pressures. As each sieve bed is depressurized, N2 is released. Valves open to deliver concentrated oxygen into a reservoir where it accumulates, and from which a flowmeter can be used for measured and continuous release of oxygen to the patient at a specified flow rate.</td>
            <td>
                We are trying to improve oxygen concentration and purity by optimising parameters and linking with the IOT, the doctor or any family member will be able to monitor the patient with the help of the device.
